## 🌐 Ethical Hacking Simulator: Expose the Truth! 🚨

Embark on a critical mission within a simulated terminal environment. This Python-based hacking puzzle challenges you to uncover confidential documents and expose the clandestine strategies of a fictional political party, Reform UK. Your goal: to reveal their hidden agendas against trans people, their financial backing, international connections, and the cynical dismissal of global crises like the war in Ukraine.

**This simulator is designed to:**

- **Highlight the importance of trans rights:** By exposing harmful policies and narratives.
- **Champion democratic values:** By illustrating how disinformation and political manipulation can operate.
- **Foster global solidarity:** By underscoring the interconnectedness of human rights and geopolitical issues.
- **Inspire action:** Towards a more inclusive, just, and sustainable world for everyone.

### 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Navigate to the Simulator:**

    ```bash
    cd simulators/
    ```

2.  **Run the Game:**

    ```bash
    python hacking_puzzle.py
    ```

3.  **Follow the Prompts:** The game will guide you with instructions. Remember to use commands like `ls` (list directory), `cd` (change directory), `cat` (view file content), `access <target>` (to hack into systems), and `find <keyword>` (to search for files).

### 📖 What You'll Uncover

- **"Project Ostrich":** Their cynical strategy to avoid public confrontation while quietly implementing discriminatory policies.
- **"Alpha-Omega Initiative":** A devastating plan to dismantle gender-affirming healthcare access, disguised as "NHS reform."
- **"The Disinformation Nexus":** How their anti-trans propaganda is funded by shadowy entities and strategically disseminated.
- **"The Global Web":** Their chilling connections to international anti-LGBTQ+ networks and illiberal movements, often aligning with anti-democratic sentiments and dismissive of global humanitarian needs.
- **"The Human Cost":** Ultimately, you'll expose the party's dehumanizing views and cynical exploitation of individuals, triggering a massive simulated public leak.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **fictional simulator** created for educational and advocacy purposes. It does not represent actual events, individuals, or organizations. Any resemblance to real entities is purely coincidental and serves to highlight the _types_ of issues and tactics encountered in real-world political discourse. The "Reform UK" in this simulator is a fictional entity, not to be confused with any existing political party.
